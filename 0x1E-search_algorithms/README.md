### Summary of 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

#### Search Algorithm
A search algorithm is a method or procedure used to locate a specific item or value within a collection of data.

#### Linear Search
Linear search involves sequentially checking each element of a list until the desired element is found or the entire list has been traversed. It has a time complexity of O(n) and is suitable for unsorted data.

#### Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm, especially for sorted lists. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the desired element is found. It has a time complexity of O(log n) and requires the data to be sorted beforehand.

#### Best Search Algorithm Selection
The best search algorithm to use depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific requirements of the search. For unsorted data or small lists, linear search may be more appropriate due to its simplicity. However, for large sorted datasets, binary search offers superior performance. It's essential to consider factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and data organization when selecting the appropriate search algorithm for a given task.
